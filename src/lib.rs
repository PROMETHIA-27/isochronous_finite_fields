//! This crate implements
//! [finite field arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field_arithmetic)
//! on finite fields with 2<sup>8</sup> elements, often denoted as GF(2<sup>8</sup>),
//! in an [isochronous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochronous) manner. This means that it will always
//! run in the same amount of time, no matter the input.
//!
//! The implementation isochronous, because it:
//! * is branch free
//! * runs in constant time
//! * doesn't do table lookups
//!
//! This crate uses the irreducible polynomial
//! <i>x</i><sup>8</sup> + <i>x</i><sup>4</sup> + <i>x</i><sup>3</sup> + <i>x</i> + 1
//! for multiplication, as
//! standardized for the AES algorithm in
//! [FIPS 197](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/fips/197/final/documents/fips-197.pdf).
//!
//! # Example
//! ```
//! # use isochronous_finite_fields::GF;
//! // Add two elements of the Galois field GF(2^8) together.
//! assert_eq!(GF(5) + GF(12), GF(9));
//!
//! // Subtract two elements of the Galois field GF(2^8).
//! assert_eq!(GF(32) - GF(219), GF(251));
//!
//! // Multiply two elements of the Galois field GF(2^8) together.
//! assert_eq!(GF(175) * GF(47),  GF(83));
//!
//! // Calculate the multiplicative inverse of GF(110) in the Galois field GF(2^8).
//! assert_eq!(GF(110).multiplicative_inverse(), GF(33));
//! assert_eq!(GF(110) * GF(33), GF(1));
//! ```
